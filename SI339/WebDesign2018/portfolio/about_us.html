        <img id='about_img1' src='img/IMG_7629.jpeg' alt="Sydney and Pene sleeping on Couch">
        <p>We are just two dogs that are best friends. Sydney, an eleven year old golden doodle, believes she is the mother of Pene. While Pene, a four year old shih tzu, who thinks she is actually the boss, but heavily realies on the wisdom of Sydney. </p>

      <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <img src='img/IMG_0113.jpeg' alt='Sydney and Pene Sleeping in Bed'>
        <p>As you can see from some of our pictures, we LOVE TO SLEEP. We are really good at being cute and snuggle most of the day. If we are not sleeping, we are often either begging our masters for food or sitting outside in the sun barking at squirrles. Sydney is much better at catching them than Pene, but sometimes Pene will pretend that she caught it.</p>

      <p>Some of our favorite snacks include cheese, turkey, bacon, chips, eggs. Sometimes when our masters do not want to give us these treats, we will settle for cucumbers and carrots, but will not eat them with a smile... We still love them though.</p>
