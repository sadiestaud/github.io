      <h3>Our Background</h3>
        <img id='about_img1' src='img/IMG_7629.jpeg' alt="Sydney and Pene sleeping on Couch">
        <p>We are just two dogs that are best friends. Sydney, an eleven-year-old Golden Doodle, believes she is the mother of Pene. Sydney was adopted from a farm and was very shy, but after a few days her personality came out and she is the most loving and well behaved dog to walk on the planet. Her best skill is to "trap" people and make them feel guilty for not petting her. Soon enough, without realizing it, they will find themselves petting Her.<br>Pene is a four year old Shih Tzu and heavily relies on the wisdom of Sydney. Pene was also adopted through some friends and could easily be mistaken for a ball of fluff. She has extreme amounts of energy and likes to take things for attention. After she gets tired from playing, her favorite thing to do is curl up in a ball and sit in your lap. Although she is very dependent, she believes she is the boss of the house.</p>

      <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <img src='img/IMG_0113.jpeg' alt='Sydney and Pene Sleeping in Bed'>
        <p>As you can see from some of our pictures, we LOVE TO SLEEP. We are really good at being cute and snuggle each other most of the day. If we are not sleeping, we are often either begging our masters for food or sitting outside in the sun barking at squirrels. Sydney's specialty skill is to catch fish on the lake, while Pene barks and "directs" her. We also enjoy going for walks, especially when it's nice outside. Lastly, we enjoy playing with our friends on the lake and barking at them until our masters come out and get us.</p>

      <h3>Favorite Snacks</h3>

      <p>Some of our favorite snacks include cheese, turkey, bacon, chips, and eggs. Sometimes when our masters do not want to give us these treats, we will settle for cucumbers and carrots, but will not eat them with a smile... Any snack is a good snack.</p>
