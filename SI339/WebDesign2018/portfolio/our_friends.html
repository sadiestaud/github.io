      <h3>Romer</h3>
        <img src='img/IMG_5504.jpg' alt="Our Friend Romer">
        <p>Roemer Henry Gagliardi- a lovable boy who lives for the beach and feeling the cool breeze in his hair. He adores cheese of any variety, chewing socks, and sitting his boney butt right on your foot. He has a distinct fear of abandonment, refuses to make eye contact, and still has not learned that the mail coming through the mail slot is not an intruder. He is very loved, and convinced that he is the head of the household.</p>

      <h3>Charlie</h3>
      <img src='img/IMG_3468.jpeg' alt='Our Friend Charlie'>
      <p>This is Charlie (although she commonly goes by char char). She is a 6 month old yellow Labrador retriever. She likes to go on shorts walks because she gets tired easily and does not like to be in a leash. She enjoys spending her days lounging on the family room couch (which she is not supposed to be on) and chewing up furniture. Ones of her other dislikes is being left alone, she likes being as close to other people as possible at all times.</p>
